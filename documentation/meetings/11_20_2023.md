ACCOMPLISHMENTS
---

1. Functions
   - drop columns by null threshold,
   - create IN_OUT col,
   - create target variable.
2. Finished tests for src code.
3. Updated and cleaned up transform pipeline.
4. Example scripts
   - Generate & plot correlation matrix.
   - Chi2 analysis.

1. CORRELATION MATRIX
---

- Why is the correlation matrix calculated using categorical columns?
- Is the correct criteria being used to drop correlated features, i.e. "more demographic related", "more granula"?
- Why is "SERVICES" and "SERVICES_D" excluded from the feature set?  Because they are used to derive the target
  and this could be considered target leakage?

  Student Notebook Results:
  - Many of these variables are purely categorical non-ordinal.
  - Examples: Region, LIVARAG.

2. CHI2 TEST
---
- Why do they utilize a train test split before applying the test?
- Why are they performing chi2 test on ordinal variables?
- The data includes null values.  Default value for null is -9.
  Per the notebook provided the -9 was never replaced w/ null.  Therefore, the chi2 test was run w/ null values.
- Certain features (ex: )
